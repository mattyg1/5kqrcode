                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>5K QR Code was born from a simple need: making parkrun more convenient and accessible for everyone. As regular parkrunners ourselves, we experienced the common frustrations of forgotten barcodes, damaged paper cards, and the inconvenience of carrying physical tokens.</p>
                    
                    <p>The idea came to us during a rainy Saturday morning at our local parkrun. We watched fellow runners searching through wet pockets for soggy barcodes, and we thought: "There has to be a better way."</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a weekend project quickly evolved into a comprehensive parkrun companion app, designed to enhance the experience for the entire parkrun community.</p>

                <!-- Mission Section -->
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>We believe that parkrun should be accessible, convenient, and enjoyable for everyone. Our mission is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simplify parkrun participation</strong> by providing reliable, digital alternatives to physical barcodes</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhance the parkrun experience</strong> with beautiful visualizations and progress tracking</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect privacy</strong> by keeping all data local and secure on your device</li>
